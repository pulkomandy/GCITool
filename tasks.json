Haiku added Layout Management, which allows applications to look nicer at different sizes and when using other languages which may have longer or shorter text fields, etc.  \n\nFor this task, you will be searching through these old applications to see which of them still need to be updated to support Layout Management.  Check the open issues for the application and if you already see an open issue for it, make a note of the application name, then move on to another one.  When you find one that doesn't have an open issue for it, try installing it using HaikuDepot and then try adjusting your system fonts and opening/closing the application at various sizes.  Also try resizing the window(s) and see if there are any GUI issues such as cutoff text, etc.  When you find one like this, open a new issue on its github page \"Update to add support for Layout Management\".  Make a note of those as well.  We are looking for 10 that need it, and for you to submit a list of those 10 newly opened issues, along with the list of ones you found that already had support, or already had an open issue for adding it.

See provided example for a template and attach all 3 test cases in one text file (Markdown formatted). Additionally, provide test result for each test case (passed, failed) you created in Notes section (with hrev tested). If the result is failure, create a bug report.\n\nTo come up with ideas you can use Haiku User Guide (for feature tests) or Haiku bug tracker (for regression tests - put a link to the bug in Notes section).\n\nA test case should be 100% reproducible and tested functionality as small as possible but not smaller. Each test case can be for a different app/preflet. Hardware tests are not in scope of this task.\n\nTo avoid duplicating work check http://qa.kacperkasper.pl/cases/search/ to see existing tests.\n\nExample test case: http://qa.kacperkasper.pl/case/2/",
